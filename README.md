# Go with the Flow: Using Extensible and Shareable Motion Phantoms in KomaMRI

Session: "Simulation MRI: from acquisition to motion correction" - MRI Together 2025 (14:00-16:00 UTC)

This tutorial will show how to model realistic motion in MRI using the new phantom framework in KomaMRI. We will introduce KomaMRI’s motion model, in which motion is built from modular actions, time curves, and spin subsets. This allows us to simulate a wide range of motion, from simple translations and rotations to complex trajectories such as cardiac motion, blood flow, or head motion. We will demonstrate how to reuse existing motion phantoms and how to create new ones for testing pulse sequences and motion-robust reconstruction methods. The session will combine a guided walkthrough of key concepts with live demos in Julia, focusing on practical workflows that participants can adapt to their own applications.

Optional preparation for attendees: install Julia and the KomaMRI.jl package in advance, following the instructions at https://juliahealth.org/KomaMRI.jl/dev/how-to/1-getting-started/.
